# nlp_text_summarizer
Text summarization is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with automatically generating a shorter version of a text document while preserving its key points and meaning. Imagine it as a skilled assistant who condenses lengthy articles, reports, or research papers into a concise and informative summary, saving you valuable time and effort.

Text summarization has numerous applications across various domains, including:
- News & Media: Summarizing news articles, blog posts, and social media content allows users to quickly grasp the main points of information overload.
- Research & Academics: Summarizing research papers, reports, and scientific articles facilitates efficient literature reviews and knowledge discovery.
- Machine Translation: Summaries can be used to improve the quality of machine translation by focusing on the essential meaning of the source text.
- Question Answering Systems: Summaries can be used to train question-answering systems, allowing them to retrieve relevant information from large text corpora.
- Legal & Financial Documents: Summarizing legal contracts and financial reports can improve comprehension and decision-making for non-experts.
